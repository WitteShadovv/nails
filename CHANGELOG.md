# Changelog

All notable changes to NAILS (NixOS Anti-forensics Isolation & Layering System) are documented in
this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and the project
uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit history.

GitHub Releases use immutable tag-based publication. Exact stable tags are verified automatically
and published later by a deliberate manual workflow; suffixed prerelease tags may publish immutable
GitHub prereleases directly. This changelog remains the source of truth for ongoing project changes
during the current alpha phase.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Updated hidden-storage examples to open VeraCrypt-compatible hidden containers with
  `cryptsetup open --type tcrypt --veracrypt --tcrypt-hidden` before mounting the mapper device.
- Clarified post-reboot verification guidance so the standard reboot path no longer asks operators
  to manually unmount or close the hidden backend after reboot; emergency and recovery guidance
  still documents manual `umount` and `cryptsetup close` steps.
- Directed non-security conduct reports to `contact@nails.run` while preserving
  `security@nails.run` for vulnerability-sensitive communications.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-08

### Changed

- Bumped the Rust workspace version to `0.2.0`.
- Hardened release publication around immutable tag-based workflows: exact stable tags are
  verification-only, stable publication is deliberate/manual, and prerelease publication is tied to
  suffixed prerelease tags.
- Refined release workflow permissions and repository targeting so GitHub release automation works
  reliably under repository rulesets.

### Fixed

- Created `state.json` during `nails init` and preflight when needed, preventing init/preflight
  flows from missing expected state metadata.
- Fixed release workflow regressions after the immutable-release restructuring.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- Established the Rust workspace split between `nails-cli` and `nails-core`, including shared
  workspace metadata, custom error types, a filesystem abstraction for testing, and the initial
  quality-gate infrastructure.
- Implemented the core lifecycle model: typed state transitions, state-file serialization,
  checksummed state metadata, RAII state guards, and the `NailsManager` orchestration layer.
- Added the preflight validation system with checks for hidden storage readiness, swap exposure,
  available space, overlay directories, current state, NixOS configuration, symlink support, and
  selected flake build targets.
- Implemented activation support for OverlayFS-based hidden sessions, NixOS configuration overlays,
  deterministic mount ordering, reverse-order rollback, process/session handling, display-manager
  restart behavior, and NixOS build/switch integration.
- Added support for flake-based activation via `--flake`, config-fingerprint fast paths,
  missing-only build paths, automatic overlay strategy selection, `/var` overlays, optional `/boot`
  pivoting, and bind-mounted fallbacks for overlay-incompatible targets.
- Implemented deactivation and emergency cleanup flows, including standard reboot-based cleanup,
  emergency no-reboot cleanup, force-unmount fallback behavior, cleanup reporting, and post-cleanup
  verification hooks.
- Added user-facing commands and output for status reporting, verification scans, emergency
  deactivation, progress indicators, verbosity controls, no-color handling, desktop notifications,
  and notification dispatch.
- Added shell integration and forensic-safety support, including prompt/alias management,
  in-memory and on-disk history cleanup, automatic terminal color-scheme switching, structured
  logging, sanitized log paths, and timestamp-based log rotation.
- Added Nix-based end-to-end validation infrastructure covering the basic workflow, emergency
  deactivation, forensic cleanliness, snapshot diffs, and performance scenarios.
- Added reproducible Nix release packaging for the canonical Linux artifact, checksum generation,
  SBOM/supply-chain checks, dependency auditing, coverage gates, and release-path verification.
- Added public project documentation and governance files, including release reproducibility
  guidance, CI documentation, support and security policies, issue templates, code of conduct,
  roadmap updates, and public README guidance.

### Changed

- Migrated the project surface from early prototype planning into a Rust-first implementation with a
  focused CLI crate and domain-oriented core library.
- Refactored the CLI and core library into focused modules for activation, deactivation, cleanup,
  config, filesystem access, logging, manager orchestration, NixOS integration, overlays,
  preflight checks, shell integration, state, status, and verification.
- Reworked CI from the initial pipeline into consolidated, cached workflows using `cargo-llvm-cov`,
  pinned tooling, reusable release/reproducibility jobs, and trusted full E2E validation.
- Replaced deprecated `serde_yaml` usage with `serde-saphyr` and refreshed Rust/GitHub Actions
  dependencies, including `thiserror`, `colored`, `signal-hook`, and Node.js 24-compatible actions.
- Aligned public documentation with the current alpha threat model, release process, support scope,
  NAILS OS separation, artifact format, and AI-assisted development disclosure.

### Removed

- Removed the legacy Python implementation after the Rust migration became the maintained code path.

### Fixed

- Hardened activation and deactivation around partial overlays, same-device submounts, overlay
  permission mismatches, display-manager restart timing, NixOS generation switching, fast-path
  activation, and deactivation base-configuration checks.
- Hardened hidden configuration and hardware-configuration handling to fail earlier and avoid unsafe
  or ambiguous activation states.
- Improved forensic cleanup by addressing shell-history persistence, alias stdout leakage,
  cleanup/log formatting, temporary-file cleanup, and post-deactivation artifact checks.
- Stabilized E2E and unit coverage by serializing fragile switch-to-configuration tests, moving real
  filesystem tests into test-only paths, expanding activation/deactivation guard coverage, and
  bringing measured coverage above the documented threshold.
- Fixed release and CI regressions around workflow permissions, reproducibility comparisons,
  GitHub CLI repository targeting, artifact naming, release tag handling, cargo-sbom output format,
  Dependabot configuration, and pre-commit coverage parity.

### Security

- Added comprehensive shell-history protection and cleanup verification for forensic-safety goals.
- Added SBOM generation, dependency/security audit workflows, cargo-geiger integration, and public
  vulnerability-handling documentation.
